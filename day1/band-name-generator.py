'''
In this project I used knowledge in
functions as input and print, variables and string manipulation
to create a program that generate a band name
'''

print("Hello welcome to band names. Let's go!! ")

city = input("Where did you grow up?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of your favorite pet?\n")
Band = "Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet

print(Band)
